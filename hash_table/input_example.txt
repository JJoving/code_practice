Comrades friends ladies and gentlemen

Time stops for no one and the seasons keep changing As we usher in 2019 Id like to extend my New Year wishes from Beijing to you all

2018 has been a full year and we approached it with steadfast determination Despite all sorts of risks and challenges we pushed our economy towards highquality development sped up the replacement of the old drivers of growth and kept the major economic indicators within a reasonable range We made headway in our efforts to protect our blue skies and to defend our rivers and soil from pollution And we intensified our efforts to improve peoples wellbeing and steadily raise our standard
of living National strategies such as the coordinated development of the BeijingTianjinHebei region the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt and the construction of the GuangdongHong KongMacao Greater Bay Area were steadfastly implemented During my inspection tours around the country I was pleased to see the lush green banks of the Yangtze River the ocean of rice sprouting from the 1100hectare pilot plot at Jiansangjiang Ranch the lively Shenzhen Qianhai Harbor the
bustling Shanghai Zhangjiang Hightech Park and the bridge that brings together Hong Kong Zhuhai and Macao These achievements are all thanks to the hard work of people from all of Chinas ethnic groups who are the trailblazers of the new era

Over the past year our country has continued to change thanks to homegrown initiatives in manufacturing innovation and construction We successfully launched the Change4 lunar probe our second aircraft carrier set sail on its maiden voyage our domesticallymade large amphibious aircraft took to the skies for the first time and the Beidou Satellite Navigation System has gone global Let me take this opportunity to salute every scientist every engineer and every nation builder who made
these achievements possible

We have also made great strides in our poverty alleviation efforts in the past year Another 125 poor counties and 10 million povertystricken rural residents were lifted out of poverty We reduced the price of 17 cancerfighting drugs and included them on our medical insurance list And we are continuing to tackle the financial strain that can accompany a family member falling ill Our comrades on the front lines of the fight against poverty are often in my thoughts including the
28million officials living and working in villages and the local village leaders They are devoted to their work and do an awesome job and I wish them good health

My heart goes out to the people living in hardship In Sanhe Village of Liangshan in Sichuan Province I visited the families of two villagers from the Yi people In Sanjianxi Village in Jinan City in Shandong Province I sat down with the family of Zhao Shunli to hear about their daytoday lives In the Donghuayuan community in the city of Fushun in Liaoning Province I visited Chen Yufangs family to learn about how they were settling in after being relocated from a dangerous area In
Lianzhang Village in Qingyuan in Guangdong Province I discussed with a villager named Lu Yihe how we could help to relieve his households poverty I can vividly recall their downtoearth sincerity I would like to wish all of them and their fellow villagers a prosperous and thriving New Year

In 2018 we celebrated the 40th anniversary of Chinas reform and opening up We unveiled a comprehensive and systematic overhaul of both Party and State institutions We launched over 100 major reform measures held the first China International Import Expo and began construction of a pilot free trade zone in Hainan The world has seen Chinas accelerating reform and opening up and its determination to carry it forward Chinas reforms will never stop and its doors will only open ever wider

I noticed that in the past year most of the people who went into college when enrollments first resumed in 1977 have retired In their place a large number of people born after the year 2000 have entered into university More than 100 million people from our rural areas are gradually becoming permanent residents in our cities 13 million have found jobs and construction has begun on 58 million new homes for those people living in dilapidated houses Many have already moved into their new
warm homes Many people from Hong Kong Macao and Taiwan now have resident permits for the mainland and Hong Kong has become a stop on our highspeed railway network China as a country of people on the move is energetically pursuing prosperity We are running at full speed towards the realization of our dreams

At this point Id like to mention several leading lights Theres Nan Rendong a Chinese scientist after whom an asteroid was named a few months ago Lin Junde and Zhang Chao who joined the long list of exemplary soldiers in the Peoples Liberation Army Wang Jicai who for thirtytwo years served on a border island and Huang Qun Song Yuecai and Jiang Kaibin who sacrificed their lives protecting an experimental offshore platform and there are many others who have made the ultimate
sacrifice for their country They are the most admirable people in Chinas new era and we should remember their names forever and learn from their deeds

In 2018 China played host to many friends both old and new We hosted the annual Boao Forum for Asia the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Qingdao as well as the Beijing Summit of the Forum on ChinaAfrica Cooperation We put Chinas proposals on the table and made our voice heard at these and other diplomatic events Me and my colleagues visited five continents and attended many important diplomatic occasions We spoke with state leaders about wideranging issues we
strengthened our friendships we enhanced mutual trust and we enlarged our circle of friends

In 2019 we will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Peoples Republic of China Our country has braved thorny paths and confronted stormy weather over the past seventy years Our people are the countrys solid foundation and our main source of confidence as the ruling party Through the years Chinas people have been selfreliant and worked diligently to create miracles that the world has marveled at And now looking forward despite the complexities and difficulties we
may face on the road ahead we shall always closely rely on the people and their spirit of selfstriving and hard work With rocksolid confidence and racing against time with unwavering determination we will carry forward our great cause bitbybit and leave enduring footprints behind us

2019 will see both opportunities and challenges that will require us to work together shoulderto shoulder Policies to cut taxes and fees must take root in order to ease the burden on enterprises We must show our sincere appreciation to talent of all kinds and stimulate their creative energy We must lend an ear to our officials at the grassroots and bring energy and greater purpose to those who are ready to commit to making a difference We shall remain focused and work hard to
achieve our task of lifting another 10 million rural residents out of poverty as planned We shall take better care of our retired servicemen and women  they have made great contributions to this country Even as we speak there are deliverymen street cleaners taxi drivers and countless others who are hard at work We should share our gratitude with these workers who contribute to the creation of our beautiful society Their hard work is much appreciated

Looking at the world at large were facing a period of major change thats rarely seen in a century No matter what these changes bring China will remain resolute and confident in its defense of its national sovereignty and security And Chinas sincerity and goodwill to safeguard world peace and promote common development will remain unchanged We will continue to push ahead with the construction of the Belt and Road Initiative and continue to advocate for the development of a
community of shared future for mankind And we will work tirelessly for a prosperous and beautiful world

As we ring in the New Year lets embrace 2019 with confidence and expectation

I give my best wishes to China And my best wishes to the world

Thank you
